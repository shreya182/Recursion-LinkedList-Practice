Instructions:
Recursion- use make and ./test to run
Linked_list- use make and ./test to run
Limitations: None
Extra Credit: I used a recursive selection sort algorithm for sort_descending().
It selects the smallest element from unsorted portion and swaps it with first unsorted element,
O(n^2) time O(1) space
Complexity Analysis: 
    sort_ascending(): used merge sort, runtime complexity O(n*log(n))
    sort_descending(): used selection sort, runtime complexity O(n^2)
